# Custom Contract Generation

A Shiny App for generating custom mercenary contracts for Battletech and MekHQ. The shiny app can be found [here](https://aarongullickson.shinyapps.io/generate_contracts/). Detailed instructions are in the text subdirectory.

You can run this application locally through [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). Just download or clone the repository. Open the `app.R` script in Rstudio and you will see a "Run App" button in the upper right. To make simple changes to the modifiers, you can modify any of the tables in the `tables` directory and these will be reflected in the app.
