## Definitions used in calculations

### Hall Types

These are the hall types from *Campaign Operations*. Examples of each kind of hall would be:

| Hall          | Examples                                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Questionable  | Antallos (Port Krin), Astrokazy, Fletcher |
| Minor         | Herotitus, Northwind, Westerhand          |
| Standard      | Arc Royal, Solaris VII                    |
| Great         | Galatea, Outreach                         |

### Unit Ratings

I use the Dragoon Ratings. To convert numeric ratings from *Campaign Operations*, use the following table:

| Dragoon Rating | Campaign Op Rating |
|----------------|--------------------|
| None           |                 0  |
| F              |                 1  |
| D              |               2-3  |
| C              |               4-5  |
| B              |               6-7  |
| A              |               8-9  |
| A*             |              10+   |

### Employer

The generation procedure does not specify a particular employer but rather a type. This creates more flexibility depending on time period. Players could roll for a specific employer among the candidates that make sense in a time period or could just decide on an employer based on the mission and context of the time period. 

| Employer                 | Examples                                                                                        |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Major Power              | Great Houses, Comstar, Clans                                                                    |
| Minor Inner Sphere Power | St. Ives Compact, Word of Blake, Rassalhague Republic, Duchy of Oriente, Terracap Confederation |
| Major Periphery Power    | Taurus Concordat, Magistracy of Canopus, Outworlds Alliance, Marian Hegemony                    |
| Minor Periphery Power    | Circinus Federation, Rim Collection, Fronc Reaches, Niops Association, Filtvelt Coalition       |
| Planetary Government     | Verthandi, Kaumberg, Novo Franklin, New Home,  Sheratan                                         |
| Corporation              | Interstellar Expeditions, Sitwell Corporation, GM, Lockheed CBM                                 |
| Private Party            | Chandesakhar Kurita, Duke Dresari, Duke Hassid Ricol, Mr. Askai, Oriente Rockfest               |

### Pay multiplier

The pay multiplier here is based on the average base pay received in a month by the unit. According to *Campaign Operations*, this base pay should be equal to 75% of the unit's peacetime operating cost plus 5% of the total cost of combat units. The actual monthly pay for the contract should be determined by multiplying this base by the payment multiplier.

Personally, I find that this base pay rate is quite high. At 5% of the total cost of combat units, you are getting an annual return of about 80% on the mercenary unit's capital! Now, mercenary life is a high risk investment so it makes sense that the return should be high, but this is extreme. And that is for a basic garrison duty contract with a multiplier of 1 - many mission types will inflate this even higher. I instead use 2.5% of the total cost of combat units as the base monthly pay. That gives you a solid 34% annual rate of return for a gravy job like garrision duty.
