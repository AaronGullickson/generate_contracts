## Definitions used in calculations

### Hall Types

These are the hall types from *Campaign Operations*. Examples of each kind of hall would be:

| Hall          | Examples                             |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Questionable  | Antallos (Port Krin), Astrokazy      |
| Minor         | Fletcher, Herotitus, Solaris VII     |
| Standard      | Arc Royal, Northwind                 |
| Great         | Galatea, Outreach                    |

### Unit Ratings

I use the Dragoon Ratings. To convert numeric ratings from *Campaign Operations*, use the following table:

| Dragoon Rating | Campaign Op Rating |
|----------------|--------------------|
| None           |                 0  |
| F              |                 1  |
| D              |               2-3  |
| C              |               4-5  |
| B              |               6-7  |
| A              |               8-9  |
| A*             |              10+   |

### Pay multiplier

The pay multiplier here is based on the average base pay received in a month by the unit. According to *Campaign Operations*, this base pay should be equal to 75% of the unit's peacetime operating cost plus 5% of the total cost of combat units. The actual monthly pay for the contract should be determined by multiplying this base by the payment multiplier.

Personally, I find that this base pay rate is quite high. At 5% of the total cost of combat units, you are getting an annual return of about 80% on the mercenary unit's capital! Now, mercenary life is a high risk investment so it makes sense that the return should be high, but this is extreme. And that is for a basic garrison duty contract with a multiplier of 1 - many mission types will inflate this even higher. I instead use 2.5% of the total cost of combat units as the base monthly pay. That gives you a solid 34% annual rate of return for a gravy job like garrision duty.
