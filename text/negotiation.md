## Negotiating the Contract

### Negotiating points

The player's side has three negotiating points that can be used to potentially shift the value of the contract in some way. Each point can be used to do one of the following:

* Increase the pay multiplier by 0.05 (5%).
* Increase the length of the contract by a month.
* Increase the dice roll by one for any supplemental item, except for the MRBC.
* Shift from exchange salvage rights to full salvage rights.

Multiple points can be applied to the same thing, but each one is resolved individually.

A negotiator with the *Haggler* perk gets one additional negotiating point.

### The negotiation

When the player decides to negotiate a point, they make an opposed negotiation check with the NPC negotiator. Both roll 2d6 and compare this to their target number. If both fail or both have the same margin of success, then roll again. Otherwise, the winner is the one with the highest margin of success.

If the player wins, then the negotiation was successful and they may adjust the contract. If the opposing negotiator wins, the negotiation is unsuccessful and the contract is unchanged. Either way, a negotiating point is lost.

### Regaining negotiating points

The player may regain a negotiating point by doing the following:

* Decrease the pay multiplier by 0.1 (10%)
* Decrease the dice roll by two for any supplemental item, except for the MRBC and the Overhead. 
* Shift from full salvage rights to exchange salvage rights and reduce the dice roll for salvage by one.

Lowering salvage below a percentage value by these means is equivalent to no salvage.
